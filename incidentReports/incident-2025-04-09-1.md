At 10:41am on 4/9/2025, all users encountered a website outage, specifically getting errors back when attempting to fetch data from the factory. The event was triggered by a high number of pizza orders sent to the factory at once.

The incident reoccured at 11:27, 11:38, and 12:45.

This incident was detected when I looked at the logs around 2pm and resolved the issue. I wasn't simulating traffic, so it was very hard to find. That was my mistake, delaying response time by several hours.
